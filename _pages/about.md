### Aleksandr Popkov 

I am a Data Scientist at GazpromNeft and a Research Associate at 
Zoological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences in  Saint Petersburg. 


My _alma mater_ is Saint Petersburg State University where I graduated with a specialization of mathematical and statistical methods in Economics advised by [Dr. Sci. Nikolai Hovanov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolai-Hovanov) and gained 
MSc in Business Informatics with a focus on constructing statistical models to bring value. 

I was fortunate to came into the biology research (mainly taxonomy in entomology) thanks to [Alexey Solodovnikov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexey-Solodovnikov) from the University of Copenhagen and to immerse myself 
in research work in the intersection of deep learning and species identification. 

I am interested in the **AI4Science** as well as in **AI4Industry**, and, in particular,
interpretable machine learning, language models reasoning (in combinatorial tasks, COPs, in particular), and multimodal learning.  I aim to learn to make better research and to write valuable code.


*_Although Aleksandr is my official transcript, I use Alexander as well_.
