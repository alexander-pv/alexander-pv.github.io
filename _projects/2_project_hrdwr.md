So, I have an old but reliable router `Zyxel Keenetic 4G Rev.A`.

This is how it looks like:

It seems like manufacturer added 2 antenna connectors, but something didn't go according to plan.

My question was: **_How can I turn it into tiny general-purpose computing device with network connection?_**
Long story short, I found out that many years ago people did that to almost any similar device before [openwrt](https://openwrt.org/)
including with the type I have.
To honor the person who figured out how to put all the necessary components for user access on a flash drive, I posted this long-lost project in Github.

The router chip has [`MIPS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) architecture and even **20Mb** of free RAM.

Going back to the initial question, what project should I pick with requirements <20Mb of RAM and Gigabytes of flash memory ðŸ¤”
